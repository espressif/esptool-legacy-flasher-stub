# esptool-legacy-flasher-stub

This project is based on the original flasher stub of [esptool](https://github.com/espressif/esptool). It will be deprecated in the near future. It is not advised to base projects on it because it won't receive official support from Espressif Systems. The new and supported flasher stub will be the [esp-flasher-stub](https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-flasher-stub) project.

# How To Use

1. Install esptool in [development mode](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esptool/en/latest/esp32/contributing.html#development-setup).
2. Obtain the flasher stub binaries as JSON files either from the [releases page](https://github.com/espressif/esptool-legacy-flasher-stub/releases) or from the artifacts of your pull request.
3. Replace the esptool's JSONs files in the `esptool/targets/stub_flasher` directory with the obtained JSON files.
